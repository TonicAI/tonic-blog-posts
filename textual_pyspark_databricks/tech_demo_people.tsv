First	Last	Biography
Grace	Hopper	Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. She was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. Hopper is best known for her trailblazing contributions to developing the first compiler for a computer programming language.
Alan	Turing	Alan Turing was a British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist. He was instrumental in breaking the German Enigma code during World War II and is considered one of the fathers of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
Margaret	Hamilton	Margaret Hamilton is an American computer scientist and systems engineer. She led the team that developed the software for the Apollo space program, ensuring the success of the moon landings. Her work laid the foundation for modern software engineering.
Dennis	Ritchie	Dennis Ritchie was an American computer scientist who created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system. His work has had a lasting impact on the field of computer science and the development of modern software.
Jean	Sammet	Jean Sammet was a pioneering American computer scientist who developed the FORMAC programming language. She was an advocate for the advancement of programming languages and one of the first female leaders in the field.
Barbara	Liskov	Barbara Liskov is an American computer scientist who made significant contributions to programming languages, systems design, and distributed computing. She is known for the Liskov substitution principle, which is a key concept in object-oriented programming.
Donald	Knuth	Donald Knuth is an American computer scientist and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. He is the author of the multi-volume work 'The Art of Computer Programming' and is known for his work on algorithms and the creation of the TeX typesetting system.
Frances	Allen	Frances Allen was an American computer scientist and pioneer in the field of optimizing compilers. She was the first woman to win the Turing Award, recognized for her work on compiler optimization and parallel computing.
John	McCarthy	John McCarthy was an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist. He was one of the founders of the field of artificial intelligence, coining the term itself, and developed the Lisp programming language, which became a staple of AI research.
Mary	Jackson	Mary Jackson was an American mathematician and aerospace engineer at NASA. She was one of the first African-American women to work as an engineer at the agency and was instrumental in advancing the field of aerodynamics.
